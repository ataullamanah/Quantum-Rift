# Quantum Rift

Welcome to **Quantum Rift**, a minimalist puzzle-action game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Guide a particle through rifts (portals) to reach the goal in each level while dodging moving obstacles. With its sleek design and escalating challenges, Quantum Rift is a unique showcase of my game development skills.

This project is created to demonstrate my passion for coding and creativity. If you enjoy Quantum Rift, please consider supporting my work through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ataullamanah) to help me build more innovative projects!

## 🌌 Gameplay

- **Objective**: Navigate the particle to the green goal using purple rifts while avoiding red obstacles.
- **Controls**:
  - **Arrow Keys**: Move the particle (up, down, left, right).
  - **R**: Restart the current level.
- **Mechanics**:
  - The particle moves in a grid-based world.
  - Rifts teleport the particle to their linked partner.
  - Obstacles move in predictable patterns; colliding with them resets the level.
  - Reach the goal to advance to the next level, with more obstacles as levels increase.
- **Goal**: Progress through as many levels as possible.
